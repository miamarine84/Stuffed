## Overview
We've all been there: You and your significant other are hungry but can't agree on a place to eat. 
Stuff'd makes it easy! Instead of listing off dozens of restaurants or searching for hours to find 
a restaurant you are both in the mood for, simply swipe through a list of restaurants nearby! Swiping 
left is a "NO!", swiping right is an "Ohhhh yeah". Once you both swipe right on the same restaurant, 
Stuff'd will notify you of your match, and just like that you've agreed on a place to eat in no time!
What are you waiting for? Insert the username of the person you want to eat with to start swiping!
