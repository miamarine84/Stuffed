Now GF bugging so cant get that done within time. But will get done soon. Also check as there is an unhandledPromise in the terminal but its working fine.

        //Woke up before work and got both arrays for both users likes showing up fine just need comparison filter is the way to go it seems go here if anything https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30389599/comparing-and-filtering-two-arrays
